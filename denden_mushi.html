<p><strong>LoaLoaApp</strong> built the <strong>DenDen Mushi Ringtone Maker</strong> app as a <strong>free</strong> app. This SERVICE is provided by <strong>LoaLoaApp</strong> at no cost and is intendedfor use as is.</p>

<p><strong>LoaLoaApp</strong> itself does not collect any data from you in any way or form. All of our apps are free, so we really don't have any money to buy a server... Anyway, AppInventor and Google may collect some data about you or your device through our apps that we have no control over. Look at their privacy policies if you really want to get into detail about what is being collected by them.</p>
<p>Permission Notice: Some people are concerned about the excess permissions in our apps. AppInventor, (the service we use to create our apps) adds the permissions by itself that we can't remove. Most of the permissions in our apps are not even used by us.</p>
<p><em>Best Regards,</em></p>
<p><strong>LoaLoaApp.</strong></p>
